### If You Must Choose Among Your Children, Pick the Right One

Brittany Fasy, Brad McCoy, David Millman, and I published a paper in CCCG 2020, titled 
[If You Must Choose Among Your Children, Pick the Right One](../../assets/cccg20.pdf)

Abstract: Given a simplicial complex K and an injective function f from the vertices of K to R, we consider algorithms that extend f to a discrete Morse function on K. 
We show that an algorithm of King, Knudson and Mramor can be described on the directed Hasse diagram of K. 
Our description has a faster runtime for high dimensional data with no increase in space.

### Nifty Poking Video

As a collaborative project between students in the fields of design and computational geometry, Brad McCoy, Marco Huot, and I made a video to illustrate some of the motivations for discrete Morse theory.
