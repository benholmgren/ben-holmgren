### DMT Applications in Neuroscience

For a final project in my Advanced Algorithm topics course in Fall 2020, Ryan Hansen and I
outlined an equivalent Morse theory framework to categorize neurons based on their morphologies
as is done via radial filtrations by Kathryn Hess et. al. We don't provide any time complexity
improvements, but as DMT improves this becomes increasingly possible. Plus, applying DMT to
things is just a whole bunch of fun.

### Nifty Poking Video

As a collaborative project between students in the fields of design and computational geometry, Brad McCoy, Marco Huot, and I made a video to illustrate some of the motivations for discrete Morse theory.
